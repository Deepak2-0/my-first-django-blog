  <!-- Time to explain the mysterious {% url 'post_detail' pk=post.pk %}. 
    As you might suspect, the {% %} notation means that we are using Django 
    template tags. This time we will use one that will create a URL for us!

    The post_detail part means that Django will be expecting a URL in blog/urls.py 
    with name=post_detail

    And how about pk=post.pk? pk is short for primary key, which is a unique
     identifier for each record in a database. Every Django model has a field
      which serves as its primary key, and whatever other name it has, it can
       also be referred to as "pk". Because we didn't specify a primary key 
       in our Post model, Django creates one for us (by default, a field named 
       "id" holding a number that increases for each record, i.e. 1, 2, 3) and
        adds it as a field to each of our posts. We access the primary key by
         writing post.pk, the same way we access other fields (title, author, etc.)
          in our Post object! -->
